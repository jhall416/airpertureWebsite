        <div class="page-content">
          <ul>
            <li><h3>Weathering and aging:</h3> The typical life span of a multi-ply low slope roof is 20-30 years and around 15-25
              years for a single-ply roof. All roofs are subject to normal weathering and aging, with the effects usually visible. </li>
            <li><h3>Storm Damage:</h3> High winds, hail, and other weather events can create damage to roofs that may trigger repairs or
              insurance claims. Roofs should be inspected immediately following weather events to prevent further damage due to water
              infiltration. Tree limbs and branches can fall on roofs resulting in significant damage.</li>
            <li><h3>Proper drainage:</h3> The ability of a roof to drain water is one of the most important characteristics. Standing water
              on a roof increases the likelihood of moisture infiltration. Leaves, trash, debris, and thrown objects often clog or obstruct
              roof drains, thus creating standing water conditions.</li>
            <li><h3>Gutter Cleaning:</h3> Gutters are a particular source of concern because of the accumulation of dirt, seeds and debris,
              and moisture. In addition, tree branches scraping on roofs during wind can cause significant damage. Gutters should be cleaned
              regularly.</li>
            <li><h3>Warranty Repairs:</h3> Do not pay for a repair which could be covered under warranty. Leaks can be caused by many factors
              though only some of those may be covered under a roof warranty. When a leak is detected, an inspection can help decide whether or
              not to file a warranty claim. When a claim is filed, the contractor or manufacturer will visit the site and determine whether the
              leak or repair is covered.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Establishing a schedule for routine roof inspections should be a priority for building owners. Inspections are inexpensive and can
            provide valuable information that can prevent expensive repairs later. Roof inspections are the first step in a proactive roof management
            program that can help owners have planned and scheduled repairs instead of emergency repairs. Few other building maintenance procedures
            provide a better return on investment than regular roof inspections.</p>

            climbing tall ladders, using aerial lifts or cranes, descending from above via rope-access, standing on adjacent
            buildings, rigging up a camera boom, or shooting footage out of a helicopter will be more costly and dangerous, or yield a less thorough of an analysis than one of our drone inspections.</p>
